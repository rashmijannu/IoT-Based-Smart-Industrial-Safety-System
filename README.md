IoT-Based Smart Industrial Safety System

Abstract:

The project offers an IoT-based industrial safety system designed to increase workplace safety by monitoring flames using environmental hazards such as temperature, gas leaks, smoke, and an ESP32 microcontroller. The system integrates the sensor to collect real-time data, processes it through a central controller, and triggers notifications through information sent to a Buzzer, LED, Firebase, and Blynk platforms. Emergency contacts, including fire stations and hospitals, are informed through Twilio services, quickly ensuring dangerous identification and response with data visualization on a dashboard, and offers a scalable solution for industrial safety management.

Technologies Used:

Software:

Arduino IDE | Blynk Platform | Firebase | TWILIO API

Hardware:

Sensors: MQ-135, MQ-2, Flame, DHT11

ESP32 Dev Module
